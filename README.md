# CWL

Common Word List (CWL), a word list with common words, for word games.

## Background

I singlehandedly compiled this word list in two months. I am releasing it into the public domain so anyone can use or modify it at will.

It was a project envisioned by David Eldar, the self-proclaimed second best Scrabble player in the world.

The purpose of CWL is to bring more people to word games. Traditional dictionaries and word lists currently in use in conjunction with popular word games are filled with obscure and impractical words. 

This is still a work in progress and will never achieve perfection. Next steps are to assimilate additional word lists made by other community members, described in more detail below.

## Community

CWL will be initially implemented on the Woogles platform for playing OMGWords (Orthogonal Morphemes Game). https://woogles.io

Woogles is a community whose mission is to:

1. Create a great place to play word games online.
2. Create a tool that lets people of all skill levels from all over the world improve at our favorite board game.
3. Build the best AI our community has ever seen.

Woogles achieved a successful Kickstarter in October last year, and was created by a team led by César Del Solar, top North American Scrabble player.

## Getting Started

CSW-only words (#)

## Methodology

filtered by CSW



A data set containing 8.4M internet articles was processed and filtered by CSW

A 0-10 score for each word was computed using this formula: (10/log(1+freq("the"))) * log(1+freq(word))

"the" had the highest frequency of any 2-15 letter word, and is used to normalize the score.

2 and 3-letter words

## Next Steps

I plan on assimilating several word lists compiled by other wo

Dani Barker developed an initial word list based on the TV and movie scripts list on https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists, removing words not commonly considered words, proper nouns, and also adding in other commonly used English words. https://github.com/danibarker/CommonWordLexicon

Look at CSW words that were not in the original starter list
